**Project Title: Time Series Analysis of India's GDP for Investment Insights**

This repository documents a comprehensive time series analysis focused on forecasting India's GDP to evaluate the nation as a potential long-term investment opportunity. Throughout this project, we utilized a robust dataset sourced from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), covering annual GDP data from 1980 to 2023.

**Key Skills and Tools Used:**

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Initial data investigation to understand trends and patterns.

**Time-Series Decomposition:** Applied linear, quadratic, cubic, and cyclical models to identify the model with the highest RÂ², capturing both signal and noise components.

**Model Selection and Fitting:**
  
  **ARIMA Model:** Developed an ARIMA model, tuning parameters based on the Durbin-Watson statistic for detecting autocorrelation.
  
  **Neural Networks:** Employed neural networks for more sophisticated pattern recognition and forecasting, assessing model accuracy with Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) metrics.
  
  **Statistical Analysis:** Used statistical tests like the Durbin-Watson to check for autocorrelation and adjusted models accordingly.
  
  **Forecasting and Business Insights:** Generated forecasts for future GDP values, providing actionable insights for long-term investment strategies.

The repository includes R scripts, a detailed PowerPoint presentation of the project findings, and documentation on methodologies employed for model selection and forecasting accuracy assessment.
